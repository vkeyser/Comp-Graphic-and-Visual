### How do I approach designing software? 
When creating software, I've learned to break down problems systematically. This project emphasized a detailed, step-by-step approach, dividing the image into sections. Focusing on each section helped me work through problems thoroughly. This approach improved my ability to concentrate on critical aspects and ensured each part met the required standards before progressing. I see great value in applying this approach in future projects, as it enhances accuracy and efficiency.

### How do I approach developing programs?
When creating programs, I start by thoroughly understanding the requirements. I refine the code in cycles, using cones and cylinders to mimic different tree shapes and sizes around the cabin in a 3D scene. I focus on improving the code for each tree to achieve the desired look. This process helps me make the code more efficient and address challenges gradually, leading to detailed improvements and visual enhancements in the development process.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualizations have deepened my understanding of data representation, equipped me with data visualization and presentation skills, and broadened my perspective on creating comprehensive solutions. This experience has expanded my technical skills and prepared me for data-driven insights and effective communication in various fields.
